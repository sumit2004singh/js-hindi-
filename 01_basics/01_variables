const accountId =144553  // cannot be defined again later , as it is fixed now 

let accountEmail = "sumitsingh9811456@gmail.com" // can be defined again later

var accountPassword = "12345" 

// prefer not to use var bcoz of issue in block scope and functional scope 

let accountstate; // left after semicolon means that it is undefined 
console.log(accountstate); // if you will print that then you will find out that it was undefined
