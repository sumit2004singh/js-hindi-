JAVASCRIPT EXECUTION CONTEXT

- GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT [ for browser it is "window" ]
- FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT
- EVL EXECUTION CONTEXT

code is there in js

it runs in two phases 
first is - "memory creation phase"
second is - "execution phase"

global execution ==>> this 
memory phase ==>> memory is stored , can say keys will be taken from code and value assigned will be like undefined , but in case of fnx. it will go as a defination .

execution phase ==>> value will be assined (10 , string ...) to those keys (val=)

if a fnx is there then a seperate new executional content will be formed for that and new variale environment and execution thread will be formed . again memory creation phase and execution phase will be formed for that function . 

once one line is executed in the new executional content that was formed for the fnx. , will be deleted as the result is now formed and then the another line will be executed .
